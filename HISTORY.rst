Pending Release
---------------

.. Insert new release notes below this line

* Fix false positives in ``C408`` for calls using ``*args`` or ``**kwargs``.

1.4.0 (2017-05-14)
------------------

* Plugin now reserves the full ``C4XX`` code space rather than just ``C40X``
* ``C408`` rule that complains about using ``tuple()``, ``list()``, or
  ``dict()`` instead of a literal.
* ``C409`` and ``C410`` rules that complain about an unnecessary list or tuple
  that could be rewritten as a literal.
* ``C411`` rule that complains about using list comprehension inside a
  ``list()`` call.

1.3.0 (2017-05-01)
------------------

* Don't allow installation with Flake8 3.2.0 which doesn't enable the plugin.
  This bug was fixed in Flake8 3.2.1.
* Prevent false positives of ``C402`` from generators of expressions that
  aren't two-tuples.
* ``C405`` and ``C406`` now also complain about unnecessary tuple literals.

1.2.1 (2016-06-27)
------------------

* ``C407`` rule that complains about unnecessary list comprehensions inside
  builtins that can work on generators.

1.2.0 (2016-07-11)
------------------

* Split all rule codes by type. This allows granular selection of the rules in
  flake8 configuration.

1.1.1 (2016-04-06)
------------------

* Fix crash on method calls

1.1.0 (2016-04-06)
------------------

* ``C401`` rule that complains about unnecessary list comprehensions inside
  calls to ``set()`` or ``dict()``.
* ``C402`` rule that complains about unnecessary list literals inside calls to
  ``set()`` or ``dict()``.

1.0.0 (2016-04-05)
------------------

* ``C400`` rule that complains about an unnecessary usage of a generator when a
  list/set/dict comprehension would do.
