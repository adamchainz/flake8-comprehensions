Examples
--------

C400-402: Unnecessary generator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's unnecessary to use ``list``, ``set``, or ``dict`` around a generator
expression, since there are equivalent comprehensions for these types. For
example:

* Rewrite ``list(f(x) for x in foo)`` as ``[f(x) for x in foo]``
* Rewrite ``set(f(x) for x in foo)`` as ``{f(x) for x in foo}``
* Rewrite ``dict((x, f(x)) for x in foo)`` as ``{x: f(x) for x in foo}``

C403-404: Unnecessary list comprehension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's unnecessary to use a list comprehension inside a call to ``set`` or
``dict``, since there are equivalent comprehensions for these types. For
example:

* Rewrite ``set([f(x) for x in foo])`` as ``{f(x) for x in foo}``
* Rewrite ``dict([(x, f(x)) for x in foo])`` as ``{x: f(x) for x in foo}``

C405-406,C409-410: Unnecessary list/tuple literal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's unnecessary to use a list or tuple literal within a call to ``tuple``,
``list``, ``set``, or ``dict`` since there is literal syntax for these types.
For example:

* Rewrite ``tuple([1, 2])`` or ``tuple((1, 2))`` as ``(1, 2)``
* Rewrite ``tuple([])`` as ``()``
* Rewrite ``list([1, 2])`` or ``list((1, 2))`` as ``[1, 2]``
* Rewrite ``list([])`` as ``[]``
* Rewrite ``set([1, 2])`` or ``set((1, 2))`` as ``{1, 2}``
* Rewrite ``set([])`` as ``set()``
* Rewrite ``dict([(1, 2)])`` or ``dict(((1, 2),))`` as ``{1: 2}``
* Rewrite ``dict([])`` as ``{}``

C407: Unnecessary list comprehension - '<builtin>' can take a generator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's unnecessary to pass a list comprehension to some builtins that can take
generators instead. For example:

* Rewrite ``sum([x ** 2 for x in range(10)])`` as
  ``sum(x ** 2 for x in range(10))``
* Rewrite ``all([foo.bar for foo in foos])`` as
  ``all(foo.bar for foo in foos)``
* Rewrite ``filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, [x ** 3 for x in range(10)])`` as
  ``filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, (x ** 3 for x in range(10)))``

The list of builtins that are checked for are:

* ``all``
* ``any``
* ``enumerate``
* ``filter``
* ``frozenset``
* ``map``
* ``max``
* ``min``
* ``sorted``
* ``sum``
* ``tuple``

C408: Unnecessary (dict/list/tuple) call - rewrite as a literal.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's slower to call these types than to construct them with literals, e.g.
``dict()`` is slower than ``{}``, because the name ``dict`` must be looked up
in the global scope in case it has been rebound, and it includes the overhead
of a function call. Same for the other two builtin types here. For example:

* Rewrite ``dict()`` as ``{}``
* Rewrite ``list()`` as ``[]``
* Rewrite ``tuple()`` as ``()``

C411: Unnecessary list call - remove the outer call to list().
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's unnecessary to use a ``list`` around list comprehension, since it is
equivalent without it. For example:

* Rewrite ``list([f(x) for x in foo])`` as ``[f(x) for x in foo]``

C412: Unnecessary (dict/list/set) comprehension - 'in' can take a generator.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's unnecessary to pass a dict/list/set comprehension to 'in' that can take a
generator instead. For example:

* Rewrite ``y in [f(x) for x in foo]`` as ``y in (f(x) for x in foo)``
* Rewrite ``y in {x ** 2 for x in foo}`` as ``y in (x ** 2 for x in foo)``

C413: Unnecessary list/reversed call around sorted().
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's unnecessary to use ``list()`` around ``sorted()`` as it already returns a
list. It is also suboptimal to use ``reversed()`` around ``sorted()`` as the
latter has a ``reverse`` argument. For example:

* Rewrite ``list(sorted([2, 3, 1]))`` as ``sorted([2, 3, 1])``
* Rewrite ``reversed(sorted([2, 3, 1]))`` as ``sorted([2, 3, 1], reverse=True)``
* Rewrite ``reversed(sorted([2, 3, 1], reverse=True))`` as ``sorted([2, 3, 1])``

C414: Unnecessary (list/reversed/set/sorted/tuple) call within list/set/sorted/tuple().
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's unnecessary to change the type of the iterable or change the order of
elements within certain other function calls that will themselves define the
order of the iterable or the type that is output. For example:

* Rewrite ``list(list(iterable))`` as ``list(iterable)``
* Rewrite ``list(tuple(iterable))`` as ``list(iterable)``
* Rewrite ``tuple(list(iterable))`` as ``tuple(iterable)``
* Rewrite ``tuple(tuple(iterable))`` as ``tuple(iterable)``
* Rewrite ``set(set(iterable))`` as ``set(iterable)``
* Rewrite ``set(list(iterable))`` as ``set(iterable)``
* Rewrite ``set(tuple(iterable))`` as ``set(iterable)``
* Rewrite ``set(sorted(iterable))`` as ``set(iterable)``
* Rewrite ``set(reversed(iterable))`` as ``set(iterable)``
* Rewrite ``sorted(list(iterable))`` as ``sorted(iterable)``
* Rewrite ``sorted(tuple(iterable))`` as ``sorted(iterable)``
* Rewrite ``sorted(sorted(iterable))`` as ``sorted(iterable)``
* Rewrite ``sorted(reversed(iterable))`` as ``sorted(iterable)``

C415: Unnecessary subscript reversal of iterable within reversed/set/sorted().
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's unnecessary to reverse the order of an iterable using a ``[::-1]`` before
passing it into ``set()`` which will randomize the order, ``sorted()`` which
will return a new sorted list, or ``reversed()`` which will effectively return
the original iterable. For example:

* Rewrite ``set(iterable[::-1])`` as ``set(iterable)``
* Rewrite ``sorted(iterable[::-1])`` as ``sorted(iterable, reverse=True)``
* Rewrite ``reversed(iterable[::-1])`` as ``iterable``

C416: Unnecessary (list/set) comprehension - rewrite using list/set().
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's unnecessary to use a list comprehension if the elements are unchanged. The
iterable should be wrapped in ``list()`` or ``set()`` instead. For example:

* Rewrite ``[x for x in iterable]`` as ``list(iterable)``
* Rewrite ``{x for x in iterable}`` as ``set(iterable)``
